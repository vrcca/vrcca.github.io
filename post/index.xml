      <description>When programming in Phoenix Framework, you sometimes need to code a decision point based on the current page. To do this, we can make use of Plug.Conn&amp;rsquo;s path_info field and compare it with Routes.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have the following piece of code:
&amp;lt;%= if is_accounts_page(@conn) %&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; # Account related content &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt; To find out if the user is in the account route, you can compare the current path with the Account page route in LayoutView:</description>

      <description>Ever wondered why your tests break everytime you change production code? Are your tests difficult to read? This usually happens due to tests being too attached to the corresponding implementation. I will show a few techniques on how to writte better tests in Java.
PS.: I will call &amp;ldquo;Production Code&amp;rdquo;, the code that you write to make your tests pass.
Changing Production Code Breaks Many Tests When your tests are too specific and bound to its implementation, you will notice that any changes to the production code such as extracting a method, extracting a class, and others, breaks your unit tests.</description>

      <description>Hello world! Here is my first post.
I shall begin it explaining how I setup this blog using GitHub Pages, GitLab and Hugo.
Creating a new GitHub Pages To setup a new GitHub page, the website tutorial is pretty straightforward, so I will skip this.
Hugo Hugo is a static website generator built on Go. It is extremely fast and requires little setup to start using it.
To install it is as simple as:</description>

      <description>This is a dump from my recent experience implementing Row-level security in Elixir and Postgres for dynamically defined tenants.
Whatâ€™s row-level security? We need Row-level security (or just RLS) when we want certain users of the app to only see certain rows of the database. A good example is a user that, once logged in a banking app, can only see their transactions instead of the other users.
How? The Ecto way There are a few ways of doing that like checking for a user_id (a.</description>
